how to check for error codes in failed bind/connects
...or elsewhere - like c does? things like, `if rc == -1`?

with a req/rep with multiple clients, how does (if it does)
the server route the reply back to the exact process that
made the request?

spend 3-5 days just playing around, writing little examples,
having fun.
