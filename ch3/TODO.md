- investigate loadbalanced vs round robin (push/pull)
  - post-office vs airport immigration example

- work out how this latest fucking example is supposed to work
  - get the ruby version to work.
  - look up each of the API questions you've got


- at the end of the chapter
  - double back and really learn how each component is supposed to work
    ...and what the tradeoffs are for each combo
    ....and be able to write out what the frames look like.

memorize this text:
//  While this example runs in a single process, that is just to make
//  it easier to start and stop the example. Each thread has its own
//  context and conceptually acts as a separate process.
